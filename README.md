# 🛒 Customer Segmentation for E-Commerce  

### 📊 Project Overview  
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment e-commerce customers based on their behavior and demographics.  
By analyzing features such as **Age**, **Purchase Amount**, **Previous Purchases**, and **Review Rating**, the model identifies meaningful customer groups that help businesses understand and target their audience better.  

---

### 🧠 Objective  
The goal is to uncover **distinct customer segments** that share similar purchasing behavior, enabling:  
- 🎯 Personalized marketing campaigns  
- 💰 Improved retention and loyalty programs  
- 📈 Smarter data-driven business decisions  

---

### ⚙️ Techniques & Tools Used  
- **Python** — Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization** — Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning** — K-Means Clustering, PCA  
- **Preprocessing** — One-Hot Encoding, StandardScaler

### 📊 Key Insights  

#### 📉 Elbow Method  
- The **Elbow curve** shows that **4 clusters** offer the best balance between accuracy and simplicity.  
- These clusters represent **four main customer types**, helping the business focus on targeted strategies.

#### 🎯 PCA Cluster Visualization  
- The PCA plot clearly shows **four distinct customer groups** with unique spending and engagement patterns.  
- This confirms that behavioral segmentation exists naturally in the data.

#### 🔥 Cluster Centers Heatmap  
- **Cluster 0:** 🏆 Loyal high spenders (high purchases & good reviews)  
- **Cluster 1:** 🙂 Moderate buyers (average spending, consistent engagement)  
- **Cluster 2:** 💸 New or deal-driven shoppers (high one-time spenders)  
- **Cluster 3:** 😴 Low-engagement customers (low spending, at risk of churn)  

These patterns help the business create **personalized campaigns** and **increase retention**.
